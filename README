DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS: Inspect the POM.
===========================================
There is a production profile and a development profile.
The build is production by default.
Look at the enironment.type property setting within the pom, 
which is used to produce two artifacts (development and production versions).

The development version can drop tables!!!

To install or deploy, please use the mvn-*.sh scripts:

(a) mvn-install-dev.sh
(b) mvn-install-prod.sh
(c) mvn-deploy-dev.sh
(d) mvn-deploy-prod.sh

(a) and (b) install to your local maven repository
(c) and (d) deploy to the remote Brisskit maven repository.

NB: deployment to a snapshot repo or a release repo is governed by the version number.
If it has SNAPSHOT within the version number, it will deploy only to the snapshot repo.

You need authorisation for (c) and (d); 
ie: requisite admin credentials within your Maven settings.xml file
