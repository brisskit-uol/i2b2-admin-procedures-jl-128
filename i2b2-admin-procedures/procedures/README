#            Command line tools for administering an i2b2 project               #

PREREQUISITES.
==============
If you have i2b2 installed, then the prerequisites are almost certainly present.
Other run-time dependencies are held within the lib directory.

QUICK START.
============
1. Unzip this package into a convenient place on a server hosting an i2b2 domain.

2. Set the I2B2_ADMIN_PROCS_HOME environment variable and export it.
   This should be accomplished by editing the set.sh file within the i2b2 install directory;
   issue the following command at the command prompt:
   . ./set.sh
   There is no need to do this as root or sudo. However, if you subsequently execute
   a script as sudo, remember to inherit the environment settings:
   sudo -E ./somescript.sh  
   
3. Review configuration settings within the config directory.
   Basically three files:
   config.properties
   defaults.sh
   log4j.properties 
   
NOTES.
=======
The remote-holding-area is used in calls within remote VM's,
viz: caTissue and Onyx (maybe more in the future?).
However, the fixed caTissue ontology (caTissue-Refined-Metadata8.xml) is also held 
here for convenience. Be sure you don't accidentally delete it!!!
