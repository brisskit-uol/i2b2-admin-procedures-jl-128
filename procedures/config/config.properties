# DATABASE ARTEFACTS.
#
# The database, schemas, usernames and passwords must already have 
# been set up by another process. 
#
# See the README file for details as well as the following...
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# For Postgresql:
#
# The database name should be identical in each datasource.
# Look at the install procedures config for this value.
# By default in the install procedures this is set to 'i2b2';
# eg: db.i2b2hive.databasename=i2b2
#     db.i2b2pm.databasename=i2b2
#     db.project.data.databasename=i2b2
# and so on.
# 
# The schema name for hive and pm MUST BE THE SAME as established at i2b2 install.
# By default the install procedures set these to 'i2b2hive' and 'i2b2pm'.
# Refer to the install procedures if you have changed the defaults.
# All the others MUST BE unique to the project.
# The suggestion, for convenience, is that project name might be folded in; eg:
# if (see above) project.name=brisskit1, then the following would be OK:
#   db.i2b2hive.schemaname=brisskit1data
#   db.project.meta.schemaname=brisskit1metadata
#   db.project.work.schemaname=brisskit1work
#   db.project.im.schemaname=brisskit1im
#
# For username, the suggestion is to make these the same as schema name.
